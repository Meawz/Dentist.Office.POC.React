This is a proof of concept for a dentist's office website.
It features a navbar with: 
- Home page where you can find links to different articles
- Services page
- Contact page
- Appoiments page, where patients can schedule their appoiments and be notified on email and/or via text message(to be implemented).
- Log-In page for staff or patients to access their profile(to be implemented)

This project was made using the React framework and is a project still on going.
